To Do:
This is a non-exhaustive list of what-to-do for the attendance system.
Completed objectives will be marked with a "X".
Please add to this file if you feel the need to do so.

CLIENT:

[ ] - Improove general exception handling
[ ] - Allow client to run without server connection
[ ] - Put un-sent messages into a que
[ ] - Attempt to send que to server every /30/ seconds untill an ACK signal ("!") is recieved
[ ] - Correct and test timeout for receiving data
[ ] - Upload an up-to-date userlist and student photos
[ ] - Add a short demonstration video
[ ] - Add seperate logs and log folder for program output, seperate from scan logging

SERVER:

[ ] - Improove exception handling
[ ] - Allow interfacing between front-end page and back-end server script
[ ] - Change attendance data processing: JSON format, Hours / Total, Days / Total
[ ] - Allow for easy changing of processing variables with a front-end UI: Meeting dates and times
[ ] - Allow for easy changing of the UserList with a front-end UI
[ ] - Allow for managing multiple scanner clients: Commands, pulling, pushing, diagnostics (uptime, packets dropped), etcetera. Give each scanner a UUID, perhaps?
[ ] - Correct issues with reading header data
[ ] - Correct issues with stringing together multiple packets into a single message
[ ] - Correct and test timeout for receiving data
[ ] - Add seperate logs and log folder for program output, seperate from scan logging
[ ] - Move server and other administrative tools to a sub-domain of epicrobotz.com; "admin.epicrobotz.com"?

UN-NESSICARY CHANGES:

[ ] - Update code base from Python 2.7.x to Python 3.5.x
[ ] - Upon program completion, ensure code is PEP-8 compliant
[ ] - EZ-install package for both client and server - if there is ever a need to migrate to a fresh machine; include all dependances in (tar bin?) install package, including Python
[ ] - Release code as Open-Source freeware (see above)
[ ] - Re-format Pi's SD card on a bad scan (Just kidding.)
