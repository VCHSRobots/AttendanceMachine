Worklog for Epic Attendance Reader

Note: this file started after the first version of the reader was deployed.

Previous Work:
1. Got pip working so that we can install python packages.
2. Installed pygame.  Found that it works on the console because it
has a mode to talk directly to the framebuffer.

1. Figured out how to get the raspberry to boot up into a console window 
and be logged into user pi.  This required understanding /etc/inittab
2. Used raspi-config to cause the raspberry to boot into a console and
not run XServer or GNOME.
3. Installed "mingetty" and changed /etc/inittab as follows:
  #1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty --noclear 38400 tty1
  1:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty --autologin pi tty1
4. Editted .bashrc to run the file 'start' at login.
5. Created 'start' in the home directory to run the attendance program
if the login it on tty1 -- the main pi screen.
6. Created 'runreader' in the ~/attendance to run the python program 
epicreader.py.
