| LIVE SCANNER LOG FEED |<br>
\-----------------------/<br>
</h1>
<p1>
This page should refresh every /2/ seconds with live log data.<br>
To reduce clutter, log data will be removed from here every /8/ minutes.<br>
<br>
If you would like to use any of the "special" commands, grab a socket testing software of your choice (I recommend using "https://sourceforge.net/projects/sockettest/"), and send your message to:<br>
[Address: "epicarg.xyz" Port: "3265"]<br>
Only /3/ clients may connect properly at one time. That number is arbatrary.<br>
<br>
/!\ Please note that these commands (and this entire page!) are just a temporary feature, because I don't really know how to interact with this server's communications manager script from a html webpage...<br>
In any case, your message will be sent to the comm script, which will then send them to the scanner as a reply. In the future, this will be handeled differently; the comm script will be given messages to send to the scanner directly from the client clicking buttons on the html page. (Or something along those lines.)<br>
I will use "%" as the notation for End Of File in transmissions, and "^" will be used as the notation for End Of Transmission.<br>
"1" will be used to confirm the receiving of a message by the server to the client(s).<br>
<br>
Also, not all of these commands, at the time of this writing, are functional. I'll mark functional commands with a "*" prefix as I update the scanner's software and push it to GitHub.<br>
Here is the list of special commands which you can send to test out requesting (and sending) special data to the scanner:<br>
</p1>
<br>
<p2>
X rqln - Request a copy of the newest log<br>
X rqla - Request copies of all avaliable logs<br>
* rqul - Request a copy of the scanner's userlist<br>
X psul - Send the scanner a copy of the webserver's userlist<br>
X tgdm - Toggle the scanner's demo video<br>
